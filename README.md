# p5js projects
A collection of [p5js](https://editor.p5js.org/AGemstone/sketches) animations i worked on.

## Dependencies
This repository includes a basic Node.js project which includes a basic web server. This is due to some animations requiring a local server to access assets like images.

Install with ```npm install``` and run with ```npm run server```
